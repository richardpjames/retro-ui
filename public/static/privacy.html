  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title is-3">Will your information be shared with anyone?</h3>

<p>
  <strong>In Short:</strong> We only share information with your consent, to
  comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to
  fulfill business obligations.
</p>

<p>
  We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal

<ul>

    <strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We may process your data when it is

    terms of our contract.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your information where
    we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law,
    governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process,
    such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to
    public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement
    requirements).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may disclose your information where we
    believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
    potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving
    potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as
    evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
  </li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your
    information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale

  <li>
    <strong>Other Users.</strong> When you share personal information (for

    or otherwise interact with public areas of the Website, such personal
    information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly made available

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title is-3">How long do we keep your information</h3>

<p>
  <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary
  to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise
  required by law.
</p>

<p>
  We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for
  the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period
  is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
  requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
  information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account
  with us.
</p>

<p>
  When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
  information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this
  is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
  stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
  information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
  possible.
</p>

<h3 class="title is-3">How do we keep your information safe?</h3>

<p>
  <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through
  a system of organizational and technical security measures.
</p>

<p>
  We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures
  designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
  However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
  electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
  can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that
  hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able
  to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
  information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
  information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is
  at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure
  environment.
</p>

<h3 class="title is-3">Do we collect information from minors?</h3>

  <strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to
  children under 18 years of age.
</p>

<p>
  We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of
  age. By using the Website, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you
  are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
  dependent’s use of the Website. If we learn that personal information from
  users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
  account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
  records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children
  under age 18, please contact us at
  <a href="mailto:privacy@retrospectacle.io">privacy@retrospectacle.io</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="title is-3">What are your privacy rights?</h3>

<p>
  <strong>In Short:</strong> In some regions, such as the European Economic
  Area, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your
  personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any
  time.
</p>

<p>
  In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights
  under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to
  request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
  rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal
  information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain
  circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your
  personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details
  provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with
  applicable data protection laws.
</p>

<p>
  If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you
  have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that
  this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal,
  nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
  reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
</p>

<p>
  If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are
  unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to
  complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find
  their contact details here:
  <a
    href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm"

<h4 class="title is-4">Account Information</h4>

<p>
  Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your
  account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some
  information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with
  any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with applicable
  legal requirements.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Opting out of email marketing</strong>: You can unsubscribe from our
  marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the
  emails that we send or by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@retrospectacle.io">privacy@retrospectacle.io</a>. You
  will then be removed from the marketing email list – however, we may still
  communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails that are
  necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to
  service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
</p>


<h3 class="title is-3">Controls for "do not track" features</h3>

<p>
  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
  include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal
  your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
  monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
  recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. </p>
  <p>As such, we do
  not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
  automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
  for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
  inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
</p>

<h3 class="title is-3">

</p>

<p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>

<h5 class="title is-5">Verification process</h5>

<p>
  Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine
  you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system.
  These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so
  that we can match it with the information you have previously provided us. For
  instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to
  provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide
  with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
  communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided
  to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances
  dictate.
</p>

<p>
  We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your
  identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will
  avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
  verification. If, however, if we cannot verify your identity from the
  information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
  additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for
  security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
  provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
</p>

  <li>you may object to the processing of your personal data</li>

    accordance with the CCPA.
  </li>
  <li>
    you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information
    to third parties. Upon receiving a request to opt-out, we will act upon the
