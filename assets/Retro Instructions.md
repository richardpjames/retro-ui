The board is split into six columns, for each of the thinking hats. 

- **Green** - The green hat represents creative thinking. While wearing this hat the team should generate as many new ideas, thoughts and solutions as they can. The teams aim while wearing this hat is to increase the number of options available, before whittling them down through the rest of the process.

- **Blue** - The blue hat represents structure. While wearing this hat the team should think about the ideas raised and how they could be structured to fit togehter, and what the next steps might look like.

- **White** - The white hat represents data driven thinking. While wearing this hat the team should consider the data that is available to aid with decision making around the ideas generated. They should also consider what data would be needed to make better decisions.

- **Red** - The red hat represents hunches and emotion. While wearing this hat the team should consider how they feel about the ideas that have been suggested and consider their emotions around other issues raised.

- **Black** - The black hat represents truth and critical thinking. The team should should evaluate critically the truth of things which have been discussed and whether suggested ideas would work in practice. This hat is all about preventing the team from making mistakes.

- **Yellow** - The yellow hat represents hope for the future. The team should discuss in a positive light the future (and the past) and how they will work to improve things.

In this exercise each column will be taken one at a time before moving onto the next. The team will have 5-10 minutes to add their thoughts and ideas to each column.
